# Deep-learning-models
This repository contains various deep learning model implementations, mostly written in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) using Colab. It is designed to be a resource for learning and referencing different deep learning techniques and models.

## Introduction
This repository aims to provide implementations of various deep learning models. Each model is thoroughly documented with comments and explanations to facilitate understanding and learning.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HWAN722/Deep-learning-models.git
cd Deep-learning-models
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
### Usage
After starting Jupyter Notebook, open it in your browser.\
Navigate to the model file you are interested in and click to open it.\
Run each cell in sequence to see and understand the implementation process of the model.

## Model List
Here are some of the models included in this repository:
1. [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
2. Llama-3.2
